# About The App

This project was created by [@creativetutorials](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer)

<!--  -->

In this readme, I will be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [MockAPI](https://www.mockapi.io/) to create a simple ShoppingApp.

## About The App

In this project I have stored the data in a [MockAPI](https://www.mockapi.io/) and I have used [React](https://reactjs.org/) to create the frontend.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the app

```bash
npm start
```

## How To Store Data in MockAPI

1. Open the [MockAPI](https://www.mockapi.io/) and create a new project. documentation [https://www.mockapi.io/docs/](https://www.mockapi.io/docs/) is added for more information.

2. Login to the [MockAPI](https://www.mockapi.io/) and create a new project.

3. Create a new endpoint and name it `products`.

4. Add a new field to the endpoint and name it `name`. This field will be used to store the name of the product.

5. Note that the endpoint is created with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "price": "",
  "description": "",
  "image": ""
}
```

You can also add a json schema to the endpoint.

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "price": "",
  "description": "",
  "image": ""
}
```
